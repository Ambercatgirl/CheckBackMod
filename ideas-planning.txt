Stuff I should do before the next update [update: Stuff I should do and publish before starting to work with v1.0]

-Button display should be looped [can be done using the objects]
-Add a flickering [like daily/fighting tab] for any tab [a button is ready indicator]
   -This is almost finished, needs some stuff to be done
   -Make sure that the fighting tab doesn't light up because of not unlocked buttons [comes with the above thing] [it's a bug that I should fix for v0.9.2.1]


XP Sacrifice feature
Unlock: Some high level (Maybe 1m)
Use: Sacrifices all your xp in exchange of a good amount of XPBoost. Lost XP stat multiplies dimensions.
Requirement to use: Your level

Boss fight ideas:
-Unlockable with an upgrade [~tier 15 and level 1m]
-High stats, hp saves between fights and each kill makes it stronger
-Grants an all dimensions multiplier which increases with every kill

Lantern boosts:
x10 XP gain
x10 XP boost gain
x100 Daily XP
x2 All Dimension multi
---------------------------------------------------------
To be added ideas:
-Push notifications when a button is ready [should take a look into it + settings]

Future reference:

for (let i=0;i<game.pets.length;i++) {if (game.pets[i] is in some form) game.pets[i] = 0}
