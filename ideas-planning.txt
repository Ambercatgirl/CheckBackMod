Rebalance concept ideas:
-XPBoost is not a prestige anymore
  -It will simply give the multiplier straight away
  -Buttons will increase in amount but also cooldown [like the normal xp buttons]
  -The upgrade that makes them not reset xp will be converted to a boost to it
  -For obvious reasons, the amount given at start will be nerfed
-XP buttons scaling
Button 1 - 1 xp // 1min --> 1 xp // 1min
Button 2 - 2 xp // 5min --> 2 xp // 5min
Button 3 - 5 xp // 30min --> 3 xp // 10min
Button 4 - 10 xp // 2h --> 5 xp // 20min
Button 5 - 25 xp // 12h --> 10 xp // 1h
Button 6 - 50 xp // 2d --> 20 xp // 4h
Button 7 - 250 xp // 7d --> 50 xp // 12h
Button 8 - 100 xp // 1d --> 100 xp // 1d
Button 9 - 33 xp // 6h --> 250 xp // 3d
Button 10 - 15 xp // 1h --> 500 xp // 7d
-Fighting buff: After a fight ends, enemy stats get doubled [so like, if you have x4 the stats of the strongest enemy, you could kill it 3 times in a row]
  -Loot could also get multiplied by the stat increases [maybe at a lower rate, like ^2 stats and ^1.5 rewards]

v1.1 Concept ideas:
A frozen themed crate unlocked at level 500m
It will reset all dimensions [like a dimension reset] but the amount of crates opened increases with tiers
1d cooldown, very big stat scaling, all dimensions multiplier stat coming from pets
Very rare pets [into the thousands] but considering that you open many crates at once [+100]
Big amounts of pets required

v1.2 Concept ideas:
Prestige layer that resets everything
"Times prestiged" Milestone system for boosts/qol (Starts with x2 to XP, XPBoost, loot, stats and dimensions)
Some sort of upgrade tiers like "Starts with pet (x) on reset" "Starts with upgrades (x-y) bought"
Early progression will be based on speeding up everything as much as possible


To be added ideas:
-Push notifications when a button is ready [should take a look into it + settings]

Future reference for future features:

for (let i=0;i<game.pets.length;i++) {if (game.pets[i] is in some form) game.pets[i] = 0}
